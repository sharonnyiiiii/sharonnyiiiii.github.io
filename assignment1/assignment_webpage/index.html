              The first thing I noticed was that the website felt difficult to
              understand at first glance. Unlike a typical webpage with obvious
              navigation features, this one did not provide clear directions.
              Because of this, I felt curious and began to explore through
              interaction.

          <div class="door-back">
            <p>
              I scrolled down the webpage first, because the unusual layout did
              not present a clear path. Unlike conventional single-scrolling
              websites, this one had two different sections of content on the
              same page. I noticed hints from the images on the site, and some
              icons began to appear. I clicked on them to see what would happen.
              I discovered hidden 3D elements inside the advent calendar. I
              clicked more frequently to uncover all the hidden elements. I
              clicked across the calendar grid and realized not every box
              contained hidden elements. After ensuring I had explored all the
              advent calendar boxes, I moved to the right side of the webpage to
              expect further features. I clicked on each project displayed on
              the site. I returned to the main page and noticed that all
              previously discovered hidden elements had reset in the calendar
              grid.

              I spent most of my time discovering the Christmas icons hidden
              inside the advent calendar, which made the experience playful and
              surprising.

              The most common action I performed was clicking repeatedly to

              revealed.

              I believe the primary goal is to evoke the user's curiosity and
              encourage self-directed navigation. This method holds the user's
              attention by creating unexpected discoveries, allowing them to
              absorb the content unconsciously while being entertained.

              The experience communicates its goal by leaving space for
              imagination. As users interact, they are rewarded with charming
              elements that make the process engaging and immersive. This
              playful design keeps the user involved and motivates them to
              continue exploring.

              The experience feels designed for short bursts of engagement
              around 1–2 minutes at a time and could be revisited 2–3 times for
              renewed enjoyment.

              It communicates this through its random and unstructured
              interactive features, which suggest that the site is not meant for
              a single linear visit but rather for repeated, playful
              exploration.

              It suggests that as a user, I should not expect straightforward
              information delivery. Instead, I should approach the site
              playfully, allowing curiosity to guide me. This strategy reflects
              the importance of using design to sustain attention while
              balancing aesthetics and storytelling.

              The most frustrating part was the landing page layout. At first, I
              did not know what to do, which could easily confuse or discourage
              impatient users. An improvement would be to include a small hint
              guiding the user to click on the calendar first instead of
              randomly clicking around.

              The most satisfying part was the anticipation of opening each
              advent calendar box. Each revisit reset the grid to its original
              state, allowing me to re-explore as if it were new. I particularly
              enjoyed discovering Christmas icons with hidden text underneath.
              When clicked, the background color sometimes changed to red,
              creating a delightful "double-layered" surprise I did not expect.
