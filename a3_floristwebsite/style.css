/* ===== W3SCHOOLS TECHNIQUES MODIFIED FOR SCROLL-FOLLOWING DOOR EFFECT ===== */
/* 
I have been trying to create a door-sliding effect by using the technique of rotation of image until a certain degree, and trying to make the door image and background image to overlap so that I am able to apply scrolling animation on it. I experimented with different code and parameters, and I found out that this is the most suitable and most fit to my intention and aesthetic, and I adjusted some of the parameters.

The main challenge was creating doors that both rotate AND follow scroll position. I used several W3Schools base tutorials including CSS Transform with rotateY() and translateY(), CSS Transform-origin property, CSS Position with absolute positioning, CSS Z-index property, and CSS Margin with negative values.

My modifications to achieve scroll-following started with the original W3Schools transform example which was simply "transform: rotateY(45deg);". I enhanced this version to "transform: rotateY(45deg) translateY(100px);" which combines rotation AND vertical movement for scroll-following effect.

During my experimentation process using W3Schools techniques, I first tried simple side-by-side doors but they looked like separate panels and not realistic because there was no overlap which made it feel artificial. Then I attempted scaling doors but scale() made doors grow and shrink unnaturally and didn't mimic real door opening mechanics. My third attempt was basic rotation but the doors rotated from center instead of edges, making them look like spinning panels rather than opening doors.

The breakthrough came with the transform-origin technique where I used transform-origin: left/right center. This made the doors rotate from their edges like real doors. Then I experimented with overlap by using negative margin-left: -25% on the right door, which created realistic door overlap in the center. I also applied z-index layering with Door 1 having z-index: 2 and Door 2 having z-index: 1 for proper front/back door hierarchy.

My final innovation was combining rotateY() and translateY() transforms so that doors rotate AND follow scroll position simultaneously. The final W3Schools technique combination includes transform-origin: left/right center, rotateY() for 3D rotation effect, translateY() for scroll-following movement, negative margins for overlap, z-index for layering, and semi-transparent opacity for fridge door effect.

/* 
I experimented with different opacity values for the door images to create the right visual effect. Initially I tried opacity: 1 for solid doors but it was too opaque and I couldn't see the background behind it. Then I tried opacity: 0.3 but it was too transparent and I lost the door presence. I settled on opacity: 0.5 which provides the perfect balance for what I call the "fridge door effect".

The semi-transparent doors mimic flowers kept in a fridge to maintain freshness. This half-transparency evokes curiosity as users can glimpse what's behind while creating anticipation, just like peering through a misted glass door to see the beautiful blooms inside.

I used W3Schools techniques including position: absolute for CSS positioning, object-fit: cover for proper image fitting, and opacity property for the transparency effect. I removed the will-change property because it's not covered in W3Schools tutorials and I'm using only W3Schools CSS properties for scroll-following animations. There's no transition because the rotation is directly controlled by scroll position.

/* 
I tried with different transform-origin values to make the left door swing realistically. First I tried transform-origin: center center but the door spun around its center like a record which didn't look natural. Then I tried transform-origin: left top but the door rotated from the top-left corner which looked weird and unnatural.

The breakthrough came when I used transform-origin: left center. This made the door swing from the left edge like a real door, mimicking real door hinge behavior. I used the W3Schools transform-origin property technique and positioned the door at left: 0 and top: 0 with z-index: 2 so it sits on top as the front door.

 I used margin-left: -25% which created perfect overlap and a realistic door center seam. I also used transform-origin: right center so the door swings from the right edge, mirroring door 1. I used W3Schools techniques including negative margin values, transform-origin property, and z-index layering with z-index: 1 so it sits behind door 1 as the back door.

This creates realistic door overlap and proper swing mechanics where both doors appear to be part of a single door system rather than separate panels.

/* ===== SPIRAL PAINT PALETTE SYSTEM ===== */
/* 
This creates a realistic paint palette effect where paint dots are positioned in a spiral pattern
around a fixed palette image, mimicking how real paint sits on a spiral-shaped palette.
I learn this through asking Chatgpt is there any way that I could position my color dots with more efficient way but not manually adjust every position of any single color dots. 
KEY CONCEPTS:
- Palette image stays completely fixed and centered
- Paint dots use absolute positioning with mathematical spiral coordinates
- No flexbox or grid to prevent unwanted resizing or spacing changes
- Each paint dot positioned using trigonometry (cos/sin) for precise spiral placement
- Spiral formula: r = increasing radius, θ = angle in degrees
- Paint dots positioned at 72° intervals (360°/5 dots = 72°) with increasing radius

SPIRAL MATHEMATICS:
- Each dot placed at angles: 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°
- Radius increases by 20px per dot: 60px, 80px, 100px, 120px, 140px
- Position calculation: x = center + radius * cos(angle), y = center + radius * sin(angle)
- CSS calc() used for precise positioning: calc(50% + radius * trig_value - half_dot_size)

EFFICIENCY ADVANTAGES OVER MANUAL FLEXBOX:
- MATHEMATICAL PRECISION: Spiral positioning uses exact trigonometric calculations instead of trial-and-error manual adjustments
- SCALABLE SYSTEM: Easy to add more paint dots by simply calculating new angles (e.g., 6 dots = 60° intervals)
- CONSISTENT SPACING: Mathematical progression ensures perfect spacing without manual tweaking
- RESPONSIVE DESIGN: All positions calculated relative to center, making it naturally responsive
- MAINTENANCE EFFICIENCY: One formula handles all positioning instead of individual CSS rules per dot
- VISUAL REALISM: Spiral pattern mimics real paint palette layout better than rigid grid/flexbox arrangements
- PERFORMANCE: No complex flexbox calculations or layout reflows - just simple absolute positioning
- CODE REUSABILITY: The spiral formula can be reused for different palette sizes or dot counts

This creates a natural spiral pattern that looks like real paint dots placed on a spiral palette.

}

/* ===== INDIVIDUAL PAINT DOT POSITIONING ===== */
/* 
Each paint dot is positioned using precise spiral mathematics to create a realistic
spiral pattern on the palette. The positioning uses trigonometric calculations
to place each dot at specific angles and radii from the center.

SPIRAL FORMULA:
- Angle spacing: 72° between each dot (360° ÷ 5 dots = 72°)
- Radius progression: Each dot 20px further from center
- Position calculation: x = center + radius × cos(angle), y = center + radius × sin(angle)

TRIGONOMETRIC VALUES USED:
- cos(0°) = 1.000, sin(0°) = 0.000
- cos(72°) = 0.309, sin(72°) = 0.951  
- cos(144°) = -0.809, sin(144°) = 0.588
- cos(216°) = -0.809, sin(216°) = -0.588
- cos(288°) = 0.309, sin(288°) = -0.951

CSS CALC() POSITIONING:
- left: calc(50% + radius × cos_value - 25px) [25px = half dot width]
- top: calc(50% - radius × sin_value - 25px) [25px = half dot height]
- The negative sin_value accounts for CSS coordinate system (Y increases downward)

WHY SPIRAL POSITIONING IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN MANUAL FLEXBOX:

❌ MANUAL FLEXBOX APPROACH PROBLEMS:
- Requires individual margin/padding adjustments for each dot
- Trial-and-error positioning with pixel-by-pixel tweaking
- Difficult to maintain consistent spacing
- Hard to add/remove dots without affecting others
- Complex responsive behavior requiring media queries
- Visual inconsistencies due to manual adjustments
- Time-consuming maintenance and updates

✅ SPIRAL MATHEMATICAL APPROACH BENEFITS:
- Single formula calculates all positions automatically
- Perfect spacing guaranteed by mathematical progression
- Easy to scale: add dots by calculating new angles
- Naturally responsive: all positions relative to center
- Consistent visual appearance across all screen sizes
- Minimal code maintenance required
- Professional, precise positioning every time
- Reusable system for different palette configurations

DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY COMPARISON:
Manual Flexbox: 5+ individual CSS rules + multiple adjustments + testing + debugging
Spiral System: 1 mathematical formula + 5 simple calc() expressions = Perfect positioning

This mathematical approach eliminates the need for manual fine-tuning and ensures
consistent, professional results with minimal maintenance overhead.
